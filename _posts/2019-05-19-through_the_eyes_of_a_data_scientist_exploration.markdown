In the year 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark began an expedition to explore the new found land lying west of the Mississippi, an assignment of the Louisiana Purchase from the French. Their 8,000 mile journey encountered bruising weather, unforgiving terrain, perilous waters, raging disease and hostile Native Americans. Nevertheless, their excursion was deemed a huge success by providing new geographic maps, as well as, crucial ecological and social information. Although Lewis and Clark’s trials and tribulations traveling the continental Unites States do not resemble the endeavors of your average data scientist, there is a mutual ideology of exploration. It’s called curiosity.


In the methods data scientist’s use to explore the usefulness of the data they possess, there are truly no guidelines. They are free to exercise pattern recognition and identify characteristics that could have otherwise become absent from analysis. Data exploration is similar to the journey of Lewis and Clark because in both cases, exploration is about searching for something undiscovered. 


When examining data, Data Scientists hope to focus on variables within the dataset that could guide prized insights about the topic at interest. When several variables relate to each other, this could determine the necessity for further analysis. If exploration is omitted from the process, there would be a lack of understanding in key features of the dataset. Before computers, analysts used handwritten statistical methods to investigate trends within information. Now, most use data visualization software and programming language to diagnose observable  tendencies with the electronic information. 


Premium programming tools not only help visualize data for the user, they also interact with an entire data science team. Valuable data exploration tools allow everyone on the team to collaborate, annotate and search datasets. Then the team could aim to make interpretations, and even automate data exploration process through a technique referred to as ‘machine-learning’.


For example, one tool in the belt loop for Data Scientists is a program library titled ‘Seaborn’. This library enables the construction of attractive graphics and informative statistical charts. Specifically, Seaborn offers well-balanced choices for plot style and color defaults, defines simple high-level functions, and integrates well with other programming libraries. For example, take a look at the below plot made within Seaborn: 

 
This specific style is plot is a ‘violin plot’. Violin plots identify the probability density of data. The middle line is a kernel density estimation to show the distribution shape of the data. The wider sections of the violin plot represent a higher probability that datapoints will conform to that value, while skinnier portions represent a lower probability. The white dot in the middle represents the mean. 


For the sake of this example, ‘Year Built’ refers to houses built in a specific region. When analyzing this graphic, there is visible distinction that newer houses provide a better housing grade. The mean of houses built before 1980 contain a grade rating of 7 or below. For the average house built after 1980, the grades range from 8-12. There is a clear relationship in which the year a house was built directly impacts it's grade rating from the residential department. 


When effectively visualizing a dataset’s variables and their relationships, a data scientist is able to swiftly understand trends, outliers, and patterns. This knowledge can be ultimately used to craft stories, drive decisions, and create predictive models. Designing visualizations and charts might not be the only pride and glory for a Data Scientist, but it’s often the most stimulating. Making sense of a dataset is just the beginning of a journey that could lead in any direction. Exploration should never be forgotten.
